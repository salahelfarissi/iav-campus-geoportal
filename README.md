IAV Campus Geoportal is a *jQuery* web mapping application that allows you to navigate through a map and display information about the different buildings of the IAV Campus. Read more about the project [here](https://www.salahelfarissi.me/posts/geoportal). Visit the live demo [here](https://salahelfarissi.github.io/iav-campus-geoportal/).

## Description

The geoportal relies on the [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) library to display the map and the [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) library to handle the user interactions. The map is based on the [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) tiles and the [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) API. The map is styled using the [Mapbox Studio](https://www.mapbox.com/studio/) and the [Mapbox GL JS](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/) library.

The map in its 2D and 2.5D view is interactive and allows the user to zoom in and out, pan, and move to specific locations. The user can hover over the buildings to display the name of the building with its corresponding image.

There is also a menu to select different buildings categories. The user can also search for a specific building using the search bar. The search bar is powered by the [EasyAutocomplete](http://easyautocomplete.com/) plugin.
